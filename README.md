# Travel_Tide_-Loyalty Program-
Our travel company 'Travel Tide' has initiated a project to develop loyalty perks for our clients. We created different perks and assigned these perks to user groups that are likely to love it. The primary analysis revolves around segmenting users based on different criteria such as demographics, travel preferences, and booking behaviors.

The segmentation should grab customers attention and maximize the likelihood they will sign up for the rewards program.
This report summarizes the findings from our data analysis.
